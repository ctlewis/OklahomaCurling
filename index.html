          <p>We have as a board had several discussions pertaining to a fall league and the aspects of does it make sense and can we guarantee personal health safety.
            The decision was made as a board to not proceed with a fall league. It was not a light or easy conclusion that we came to. Observances were made that as municipalities opened back up resulting in the exponential increase in COVID-19 cases that we, as a club, should hold personal health and well being to a higher standard. An individual’s health is not worth the risk for a couple of hours of fun and sportsmanship on the ice this fall. We have all seen the results of failing to properly protect against the virus as the rapid increase brought responses of mandatory face coverings, social distancing and temporary closures for cleaning. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Going forward, we will be meeting again in the fall with the hopes that life will be returning to some state of normalcy and that we can return to the ice safely. We know that this is not the news everyone wants to hear, but more importantly, the members need to know that their health and safety matters. 
            We will keep the members updated when we meet again. With time and patience, we’ll be curling again soon. Thank you for your time and understanding in this matter. Please stay safe during this health crises and hope for a speedy return to normal life. 
            <br>On behalf of the board, <br>
            Brad Long President, Oklahoma Curling Club</p>
