<h1>Learn to Curl</h1>

<p>Our Learn to Curl (LTC) classes are a 2 hour class where we teach you the
basics of curling (delivery, sweeping, scoring) and then have you play 1.5-2
full ends so you can see how it feels to play a full game.  Public LTC's are
$25 per person and we have all the equipment required to participate.  We
ask that you dress warmish in layers and wear rubber soled tennis shoes
(anything other than rubber soled tennis shoes will not be allowed on the
ice).  Our minimum age to participate is 15 years old and we require a
parent or legal guardian be present to fill out
<a href="other/Minor_Participant_Release.pdf">the youth waiver</a>
and stay
during the entire LTC for all minors.  Our public LTC's will be posted here
once we have them scheduled and on our
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/okcurling/" target="_blank">
Facebook page, Oklahoma Curling Club.</a>
Follow us on Facebook to see when we're having our events.  (We have Learn
to Curl classes before each of our leagues- Fall, Winter and Spring.  We
post our Learn to Curl events 3 weeks prior to each event.)</p>
<ul>
<li> Learn to Curl - Saturday February 2nd, 5-7pm</li>
<li> Learn to Curl - Saturday February 16th, 5-7pm</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>For a private LTC, we require a minimum non-refundable prepayment of 15
people at the $25 per person price.  (If you have a group of less than 15,
we would still require this amount -$375.00- to have a private LTC). This
pays for the ice time we have to rent from the rink. The payment is
non-refundable since if a group cancels at the last minute, we still have to
pay the rink for the ice time. Your prepayment will need to be paid before
we schedule the ice time with the rink. If you have over 15 people, then you
can pay for the number of people over the 15 minimum closer to the date of
your Learn to Curl.  Each Learn to Curl can allow up to 60 people on the ice
for the class. We allow beverages (including alcoholic) on the ice as long
as they are in a plastic bottle or can (no glass is allowed on the ice).
