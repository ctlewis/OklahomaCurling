<h1>Bonspiel FAQ</h1>
<h2>What is a bonspiel?
<p>It’s a curling tournament!  German in origin, the word is used all over the world.
Typically bonspiels are fun social tournaments.  Typically the competitive ones are
referred to championships, cashspiels, or events.  You don’t want those.</p>
<br>

<h2>How good do I have to be before I go out to a bonspiel?</h2>
<p>All skill levels can go out to a bonspiel.  There are some ones that are more
competitive, ones that award cash prizes known as cashpiels that are pretty competitive. 
For the most part other bonspiels that are near us are just a fun tournament.  As you
get further north, they typically get more competitive, but that’s not always the case.
I’ve been to bonspiels where people have been participating just weeks after their first
learn to curl.</p>
<br>

<h2>Do I need to bring my own equipment?</h2>
<p>This will vary from club to club.  Just about all arena clubs will have step on
sliders.  Club brooms and stabilizers are generally available, but they may be limited.</p>
<br>

<h2>I heard some brooms aren’t allowed in competitive play, what’s the deal with that?</h2>
<p>This is a rule for competitive play that most clubs don’t really care about.  Go
ahead and bring your Hardline icePad.</p>
<br>

<h2>How do I travel with equipment?</h2>
<p>If you have to fly, you can check a broom bag pretty easily.  Golf bags and ski
carriers work well.  Flying Southwest you can typically check those sports bags for free.
It is recommended you carry on your curling shoes.  In case your luggage gets lost, you
can always borrow a club broom, you can’t really borrow curling shoes.</p>
<br>


<h2>What is broomstacking?</h2>
<p>Broomstacking is quite possibly one of the best traditions in curling.  At a
bonspiel there will be a designated broomstacking area of tables.  After a match is
played, the winning team buys the first round for the other team.  You exchange club
pins, stories, and generally have a good time.</p>
<br>

<h2>Do I have to be a USCA member?</h2>
<p>A: USCA requirements are only for national tournaments such as arena nationals, club
nationals, and their respective playdowns.</p>
<br>

<h2>Do we need to have a team uniform?</h2>
<p>Only for national events is it required.  But for bonspiels, wear whatever you want.
Some teams do like to have a costume/outfit.</p>
<br>

<h2>How does the tournament work?</h2>
<p>Most bonspiels will have everyone start in the A Event or championship bracket.
If you lose your first game, you’ll typically drop down to the B Event.  Most bonspiels
will have 3-4 events depending on amount of team entries.  Most will be a 3 game guarantee,
once you’ve made it to your third game, lose and you are done.  Usually the first round will
be held over a couple of draws on Friday.  The bracket maker will typically give out of
towners preferences so you can ask for the later game on Friday.  You’ll typically play one
game Friday, then depending on the bracket, you may play again at 8am on Saturday.  Expect
to play 2-3 games on Saturday and if you lose your third game you may be out of the event.
If you do get eliminated, no big deal. Typically the last draw on Saturday night wraps up
around 10pm so most people either plan to hang out at the arena with other curlers or go
out.</p>
<br>

<h2>How much time do I need to plan for a bonspiel?</h2>
<p>Most bonspiels will go from Friday early evening to Sunday around noon.  If you
survive Saturday and play on Sunday, congrats!  That should be your goal is to stay alive
until Sunday.  Usually things will be wrapped up by 2pm and most people will go ahead and
head home.  If you can afford to do so, I always recommend taking the Monday after a
bonspiel off.  Travel, sweeping, and broomstacking can be tiring.</p>
<br>

<h2>How much do bonspiels cost?</h2>
<p>Aside from travel costs, there aren’t too many expenses to account for.  You can
expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $125 per person.  Most events will have a host hotel
where you can get a club rate on it which is an easy way to go.  I’ve done AirBnBs for
groups of odd sizes. Food expenses are usually minimal as the host will provide some food.
Friday meals are iffy, usually they provide food for most of Saturday.  Usually donuts,
bagels for breakfast, sandwiches for lunch and then usually decent Saturday dinner.  Or you
can explore around town for some local places.  Some bonspiels will offer some drink tickets
as part of your entry fee, but there is typically a cash bar setup as they do it to raise
funds for the club.  There are also places like Kansas City which will have a few kegs
included with your entry.  It is also common to see that at a dedicated facility.  Bonspiels
will also typically have various raffles.  They will do 50/50s or raffle off prizes.  The
prizes vary greatly, usually a lot of booze, gift cards, local sporting event tickets, and
curling equipment.  I’ve won a broom and a broom bag before at a tournament.   </p>
<br>



<h2>How different is it curling at a dedicated facility?</h2>
<p>Dedicated facilities are great!  They’ll have a warm room for broomstacking and
hanging out in between games.  Often they have some sort of setup for a bar.  But the
best part is the ice.  The ice will be flat allowing you to throw the stone both ways
and will act in a much more predictable pattern.  Also the ice is much, much faster.
You won’t have to slide out or push as hard.  A word of caution is that there are no
dedicated facilities near here.  The closest ones are Denver, Phoenix, and Atlanta.
Typically because they are dedicated facility for curling, the level of competition is
generally much higher.  </p>
<br>


<h2>Are there any bonspiels geared towards newer curlers?</h2>
<p>Yes!  There are bonspiels that are designated as 5 and unders.  These are for
players that have less than 5 years of experience.  There are also over/unders where
2 players need to be under a designated experience level, typically 5 years.  Other
places like Omaha will run 2 events at the same time.  One for experienced and one
for inexperienced.  </p>
<br>


<h2>What are some good bonspiels to go to?</h2>
<p>You can view a site maintained on the USCA website
<a href="https://www.teamusa.org/usa-curling/events-section" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<p>Arena Clubs:</p>
<p>The one I always recommend to people in my travels is the Kansas City BBQ bonspiel.
Held the first weekend of August, it’s a very fun, social atmosphere.  BBQ Sunday dinner is
a great meal.  Kegs are provided and for the most part it is filled with curlers that are
arena curlers just like us.  It’s a great, social atmosphere.  If I could do one a year it
would be this event.</p>

<p>Omaha hosts a bonspiel around St. Patrick’s Day which is always a fun event.  The hosts
are always very nice.  They offer an experienced event and an event for the newer curlers.
They also have the best ice outside of a dedicated facility.  Unfortunately they don’t have
an area for broomstacking at the arena, but there are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby
that they setup an area at.</p>

<p>St. Louis will host a spiel over Labor Day weekend in early September.  Another arena
club, this event has been on my calendar the past 2 years and I will likely go again this
year.  Depending on the amount of registered teams, sometimes this is a 4 game guarantee
which is nice.</p>

<p>Dallas Fort Worth holds theirs in April.  It’s Dallas, so yeah.</p>

<p>Austin has theirs Memorial Day weekend.  They will have a curling class available to
sign up for.  Typically they are taught by a former Olympian which is fun.</p>

<p>If you want to go check out a dedicated facility, there are a ton out there.  I
haven’t had a chance to go to a majority of them but I can talk about a few of them. 
You can always <a href="#contact">ask me.</a></p>
<br>

<h2>How do I get onto a team?</h2>
<p>You can always contact the host club and say you want to sign up as an individual
or a pair and they’ll get you setup on a team.  Or if you only have 3, then you always
ask the host club if they have an individual they can put on your team.  However if you
are looking for other people from within our club, the best thing to do is just ask around.
You can always ask me and I’ll see if I can help coordinate some teams.  Typically that’s
easier to do for the ones that are within driving distance.  Again the one I recommend is
Kansas City in August.  That one will likely sell out this year so it’s important to try
to get signed up for that one sooner than later.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="contact">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully that helps answer any questions about bonspiels.  Last thing I would say
anyone looking to bonspiel is go into these events to socialize and have a good time. 
You may win some games, but at every bonspiel there are going to be some teams that
unfortunately finish 0-3.  I’ve been there myself, but still had a good time at that
event spending time with friends.  If you’ve enjoying curling at our club but wish there
was more social interaction, bonspiels are great.  If you have any questions, feel free
to give me a shout at
